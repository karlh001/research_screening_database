## Screening Record

Here you create separate row per project. Say, for example, you are considering patient for the study named "A Drug Study", select from the drop down, choose if eligible. If you say they are eligible, then this will appear on the outstanding report. It will only disappear from the report if you choose an outcome, such as "recruited" or "fail screen".

If you are missing your study name, ask you admin to add this to the backend database.

### Recruitment

If patient is recruited, add row to the "recruitment" section and change the outcome on the "Screening Record" section to "recruited".

## Outstanding Screen

To see a list of outstanding patients, click "Outstanding Screen" button on the welcome screen. This will open a report of patients who do not have an outcome assgined.
